"""
agent2.py
Model-validation compliance checker.

Loads MDD documentation rules from rag_store/val_mdd_rules.json and provides:
  - check_for_validation()  : quantitative rules cross-checked against dataset metrics
  - check_mdd_keywords()    : keyword-search cross-check of rules against uploaded MDD text
  - get_attestation_checklist() : descriptive rules for manual reviewer sign-off

The model-development pipeline (data/feature/training/evaluation stages) no
longer uses this class — it has been removed. All compliance logic is now
focused on model validation only.

        The `index` map is keyed by the 0-based "index" field the prompt
        asks each item to echo back (see _build_llm_prompt). It's the most
        reliable way to line a verdict back up with its rule: unlike
        `rule_id` (an opaque string models sometimes drop, renumber, or
        reformat) or plain response order (which breaks the moment the
        model skips one item mid-batch), an explicit index survives both a
        renamed/missing rule_id AND a dropped item elsewhere in the batch.

        The ordered list is a last-resort fallback for callers when neither
        rule_id nor index matching finds anything and the counts line up.

        Raises ValueError with a message that distinguishes an empty
        response (provider answered but produced nothing — usually means
        the request was cut off, so raising the relevant timeout env var
        is the fix) from a malformed/non-JSON response (a real parsing
        problem, not a timing one).

        Tolerant of several common deviations from the requested shape,
        since models don't always follow instructions exactly:
          - a JSON object wrapping the array under a key, e.g.
            {"results": [...]} / {"verdicts": [...]} instead of a bare array.
          - items using "id" instead of "rule_id".
          - a flat map straight from rule_id to a status string, e.g.
            {"V01": "PASS", "V02": "FAIL"} instead of {"V01": {"status": ...}}.
          - a bare list of status strings in rule order, e.g. ["PASS", "FAIL"].
