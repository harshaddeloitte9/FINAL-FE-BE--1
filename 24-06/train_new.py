train.py - Model Training Engine

FIX v2:
  - Preprocessor is REBUILT on X_engineered so columns always match
  - Real feature names resolved after fitting

FIX v4 (Optimal Binning removed):
  - The Optimal-Binning / WOE preprocessing path for Logistic Regression has
    been removed entirely. Every model — including Logistic Regression — now
    goes through the standard rebuild_preprocessor_for() ColumnTransformer
    path, same as tree models always have.

FIX v5 (Out-of-Time validation added — ported from Credit-Risk-Poc-main):
  - Added automatic Out-of-Time (OOT) validation:
      1. If an origination/observation date series is supplied and OOT is
         requested, the most recent slice of the data (by that date) is
         carved off as an untouched OOT holdout. Rows with an unparseable
         date are treated as development data, never OOT.
      2. Stratified K-Fold CV (when enabled) runs ONLY on the remaining
         development data — the OOT rows never participate in fold
         training or fold scoring.
      3. The final model is fit on ALL development data (i.e. everything
         except the OOT holdout).
      4. The fitted model is scored exactly once against the OOT holdout —
         never re-fit, never re-tuned against it — and OOT ROC-AUC / Gini
         are reported back in `training_info["oot"]`.

FIX v6 (Automatic class weighting; SMOTE option removed):
  - Credit-risk targets are heavily imbalanced (e.g. ~10% default rate), and
    the pipeline had a `use_smote` flag that did nothing — no resampling was
    ever wired up. Left on a default 0.5 threshold, models trained on raw
    imbalanced data with no weighting learn to mostly predict the majority
    class, producing near-zero precision/recall/F1 despite reasonable
    ROC-AUC.
  - `use_smote` has been removed. It's replaced with automatic, always-on
    class weighting: `train_model()` computes balanced sample weights
    (sklearn's `compute_sample_weight("balanced", y_dev)`) from the
    DEVELOPMENT data only (post-OOT-carve-off) and passes them into every
    fit — the plain fit, the hyperparameter search, and Stratified K-Fold
    CV — for binary and multiclass tasks. There is no toggle for this; it
    always runs for classification tasks.
  - Weighting up-weights the rare class instead of duplicating/synthesizing
    rows (what SMOTE would do), so no synthetic data is introduced and val/
    test/OOT stay completely untouched, exactly as before.
  - Not every estimator's `fit()` accepts `sample_weight` (e.g.
    KNeighborsClassifier). If the model rejects it, training falls back to
    an unweighted fit automatically and `training_info["class_weighting"]`
    records that fallback so it isn't silent.
